# LOT-010 — V0.9 — Hardening and compatibility

> Before working on this lot, read the repository root README.md.

Parent: None
Created: 2026-09-25T23:53:23

## Objective

Stabilize the feature set through repeatable tests and Windows application checks.

## Context

Source milestone: `docs/TextAid specification.md`, section 81; source-to-lot mapping: `docs/SOURCE-MAP.md`. This lot is part of the ordered V1 plan.

## In scope

Depends on LOT-009; no new feature wave.

## Out of scope

Post-V1 capabilities in source section 91, except where a narrower exclusion is stated above. Do not add features beyond this lot's requirements.

## Requirements

### REQ-010-001 — Resilience matrix

Test busy clipboard, stopped Ollama, missing model, timeout, cancellation, invalid configuration/JSON, unreachable provider, closed/elevated source window, empty/long text, repeated trigger, Escape/Alt+F4, Debug on/off, and invalid locale.

Source: `docs/TextAid specification.md`, sections 81, 85–87.

### REQ-010-002 — Text and display matrix

Test Unicode, emoji, CRLF/LF, very long text, and DPI at 100/125/150 percent across multiple monitors. If maxInputCharacters is configured, show actual and permitted counts and do not split input automatically.

Source: `docs/TextAid specification.md`, sections 27, 70, 81.

### REQ-010-003 — Application matrix

Validate capture/window/Replace/Copy in Notepad, Chromium textarea, Visual Studio, and VS Code; validate capture/window/Replace/Copy in Chromium contenteditable, Word, and Outlook, documenting replacement behavior. Elevated process injection is not guaranteed. Document app-specific behavior before special handling.

Source: `docs/TextAid specification.md`, sections 74, 81–82, 88.

### REQ-010-004 — Test layers

Run keyboard, template, configuration, fake-IChatClient, localization, and Windows platform tests. Keep live Ollama tests optional under an Integration category.

Source: `docs/TextAid specification.md`, sections 83–87.

### REQ-010-005 — Distribution rehearsal

Repeat a clean single-file self-contained win-x64 publish and installation-free run; verify no required sidecar file or .NET runtime.

Source: `docs/TextAid specification.md`, sections 9, 81, 90.

### REQ-010-006 — Invocation and translation regression

Exercise both configured invocation paths, including default `Ctrl+C+C` action choice and default `Ctrl+C+T` immediate translation, across the compatibility matrix. Cover both preferred-language directions, a third or uncertain source language, manual destination change, pending and failed translations, stale completion after a destination change, Replace safety, Copy without source modification, shortcut reassignment, persistence, and internally conflicting bindings.

Source: D-004, D-005, D-006, R-015, R-017, R-018; Olivier's later invocation and result-action decisions.

## Important cases

Validate success and failure paths described in the active requirements; use the source specification for examples and exact user-facing messages where given.

## Dependencies

LOT-009 must be closed before this lot starts. Active R-001 through R-005, R-007 through R-012, and R-015 through R-018 apply according to their stated scopes; obsolete R-006, R-013, and R-014 remain part of closed or superseded history.

## Known constraints

### Localization-maintenance warning

R-031 applies. Reuse an existing English source-catalog key for every visible string when possible. Otherwise add the English key first, reference it symbolically from views/code, and treat older-fingerprint translated caches as stale until explicitly regenerated or replaced.

The source document is retained for traceability. If it conflicts with an active Pro-Spec requirement or rule, record a finding and obtain the required human decision before changing active intent.
