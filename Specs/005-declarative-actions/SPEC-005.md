# LOT-005 — V0.4 — Declarative actions

> Before working on this lot, read the repository root README.md.

Parent: None
Created: 2026-09-25T23:53:23

## Objective

Move transformations out of C# and make the V1 action set configurable.

## Context

Source milestone: `docs/TextAid specification.md`, section 76; source-to-lot mapping: `docs/SOURCE-MAP.md`. This lot is part of the ordered V1 plan.

## In scope

Depends on LOT-004.

## Out of scope

Post-V1 capabilities in source section 91, except where a narrower exclusion is stated above. Do not add features beyond this lot's requirements.

## Requirements

### REQ-005-001 — Action data

Implement ActionDefinition, ActionLoader, and ActionValidator using unversioned JSON action files in the `actions` subdirectory beside the running executable. Migrate Rewrite and supply Translate, Correct, Rewrite, Shorten, Expand, Simplify, Change tone, Summarize, and Answer this mail as built-in action data. Answer this mail MUST require supplementary user instructions before processing. Built-in and user-created actions share the same format and no built-in action has a dedicated C# execution path. The reserved Translate action is the explicit exception to editability: it remains declarative but protected so it can reliably serve `Ctrl+C+T` later.

Source: `docs/TextAid specification.md`, sections 34–36, 76.

### REQ-005-002 — No recompilation

Loading an added valid action from the visible action folder MUST NOT require a new ViewModel, dedicated button, service, or application build. Actions can be enabled or disabled. Their stable IDs identify built-in localized names; a user display-name override takes precedence and is not translated.

Source: `docs/TextAid specification.md`, sections 34, 76, 90.

### REQ-005-003 — Text-only templates

TemplateRenderer MUST resolve only `{{text}}`, reject every other placeholder, and never parse injected user text a second time. V0.4 MUST NOT implement generic action parameters, a form engine, or named-variable resolution.

Source: `docs/TextAid specification.md`, sections 36–37, 76, 84.

### REQ-005-004 — Input-data boundary

Standard prompts SHOULD delimit selected text as input data for prompt clarity. TextAid has no model tools, so this lot MUST NOT add prompt-injection detection, filtering, or other sophisticated mitigation.

Source: `docs/TextAid specification.md`, sections 38, 84.

### REQ-005-005 — Declarative Translate preparation

The built-in Translate action MUST be declarative, protected from modification, disabling, deletion, replacement, or reassignment, preserve the original captured text as its input, and define its output-language default. Its action data MUST support the later `Ctrl+C+T` entry point without adding a separate hard-coded translation implementation. The explicit destination-language value and its narrowly scoped rendering path belong to LOT-008; changing it there will mean a new single transformation of the original text, never translation of an earlier translated result.

### REQ-005-006 — Action profile reference

Each ActionDefinition MUST declare a `profileId` that identifies the model profile to use. Built-in action data may select the local default profile; the remote profile implementation remains LOT-009 work. An unknown profile is invalid action data.

Source: D-009, D-015, R-022.

### REQ-005-007 — Editable action fields

Each ActionDefinition MUST include a unique stable `id`, a prompt template, a `profileId`, and an optional temperature override. Built-in display names are resolved from the selected application/user language; a user-visible display-name override is optional and takes precedence. The profile reference represents the selected This device only, On-premises, or External model profile; action data must not embed a provider endpoint or credential. The same format applies to every built-in and user-created action.

Source: D-012, D-015, R-022.

### REQ-005-008 — Output-language default

Each ActionDefinition MUST define an output-language default as either **Unchanged** or a BCP-47 language identifier. This is data, not a separate translation action implementation, and it becomes the initial value of the later session language selector.

Source: D-013, R-020.

### REQ-005-009 — User-instructions flag

Each ActionDefinition MUST include an `askForUserInstructions` boolean. When true, TextAid MUST collect additional user instructions in a dialog before it begins that action's model call. Cancelling that dialog MUST leave the session unchanged and MUST NOT call a provider. The supplementary instruction is invocation-only data and MUST NOT modify the action definition.

Source: D-014, R-021.

### REQ-005-010 — Editable session and action choice

The normal TextAid session MUST keep its input text editable regardless of whether it originated from a selection, manual typing, or a paste. It MUST let the user select an available action, optionally enter supplementary instructions, and explicitly start one Process operation. The request must use a snapshot of the editable text, selected action, and supplementary instruction at the moment Process starts.

Source: D-014, R-021.

### REQ-005-011 — New manual transformation

The normal session MUST provide a **New** command that clears its editable text, result, supplementary instructions, and selected action state without closing the window. It MUST then be equivalent to a newly opened no-selection/manual-input session: no original source window remains eligible for Replace, while Copy remains available after a new successful result.

Source: D-021; Olivier's session-reset instruction.

## Important cases

Validate success and failure paths described in the active requirements; use the source specification for examples and exact user-facing messages where given.

## Dependencies

LOT-004 must be closed before this lot starts. Active R-001 through R-005, R-007 through R-012, R-015 through R-018, and R-020 through R-022 and R-024 apply according to their stated scopes; obsolete R-006, R-013, R-014, and R-019 remain part of closed or superseded history.

## Known constraints

The source document is retained for traceability. If it conflicts with an active Pro-Spec requirement or rule, record a finding and obtain the required human decision before changing active intent.
